      <h1>Clima Card</h1>
      <p class="date">2019 | UI Project</p>
      <h2>Project background</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
          Clima Card is a credit card concept where the users can track their climate impact from private consumption. Everything bought with the credit card is calculated and the climate impact is displayed in CO2e. The user will get a direct feedback on their shopping and food expenses and also which purchases that will result in highest carbon dioxide emissions. </p>
        
        <h3>Background </h3>
       <p> In September 2015, the world’s leader accepted the “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, including the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda was a landmark achievement, providing for a shared global vision towards sustainable development for everybody. </br></br>
        The 12th Sustainable Development Goal is to “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns”. The everyday choices may seem marginal, but are important for a person’s total climate impact. To highlight how much these everyday choices impact the environment, I decided to come up with a product to visualize a person’s climate impact and to enable a clear indication for improved or impaired behaviour. 
          </p>
        
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>The goal is to design a concept for an app that will highlight the climate impact from private consumption regarding shopping and food choices. The app should be educational and easily understandable. I want to make information about emissions accessible and that the app feels both useful and valuable.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>I used an iterative working method, helping me to improve and polish my design. In the process, I went through four main stages; Ideation, Designing, Development and Testing. These were iterated while evaluating my design on each step. </p>
