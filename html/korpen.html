      <h2>Project background</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Korpen is a national association built by local associations around the country. Their mission is to make people do sports and have fun together. Korpen is expanding and attracts several young adults, with almost 50 000 members in the age ranging from 16-25!
        
        Korpen Göteborg arrange different sport events and tournaments in seven different sports. These are presented on their website and where users can find scores and fixtures for the leagues.
        
        <h3>Background </h3>
        Ever since I was a kid, sports have been a big part of my life and influenced me throughout my youth. During my recent years, I have been active in Korpen in their football league, both in Linköping and in Gothenburg. 
        
        One thing that I think Korpen lacks is an app where users can get easily accessible information regarding, scores and fixtures. As active in a football team, I would like to have information stored in an app with upcoming games. 
        
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        Create a design proposal of an app where scores and fixtures are available for the user.

        <h2>Why an app for Korpen?</h2>
